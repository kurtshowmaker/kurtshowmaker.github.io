**Single cell RNA sequencing of femur bone marrow cells from the NZBWF1 systemic lupus erythematosus mouse model and its progenitors.**\
Database (accession): NCBI GEO ([GSE174728](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE174728 "	Single cell RNA sequencing of femur bone marrow cells from the NZBWF1 systemic lupus erythematosus mouse model and its progenitors."))\
Summary: 

>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by failure of self-tolerance mechanisms and the resultant production of autoreactive antibodies. The NZBWF1 mouse spontaneously develops a lupus-like syndrome and is used as model of SLE. The NZBWF1 model represents the F1 generation of a cross between New Zealand Black (NZB) and New Zealand White (NZW) mice. In this study we investigated the model and its progenitors (NZB, NZW) gene expression with single cell RNA sequencing on cells isolated from bone marrow and processed with the 10X Chromium.\

Overall design: 
>Cells isolated from femur bone marrow from female 9 - 10 weeks old mice (n=3) for each strain (n=3; NZBWF1, NZB, NZW) was prepared on the 10x Genomics Chromium Single Cell controller using the 10x Chromium Single Cell 3â€™ v3.1 Reagent Kit (10x Genomics Product Code 1000268).\
